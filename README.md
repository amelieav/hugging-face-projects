# Hugging Face Projects / Spaces

## November 2023
https://huggingface.co/spaces/amelieav/test-space \
This is my first attempt at using a model from hugging space. I used the facebook/detr-resnet-50 model to make my first space, a bird detection tool.

To use, simply upload an image, and the AI returns whether it has detected a bird or not.

#### Observed Limitations:
- It tends to classify small frogs as birds
- If you submit a bad drawing of a bird, it fails to recognise it
